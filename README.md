# Data Engineering Portfolio
My name is Rael Corrales an I started uploading my portfolio of some data processing projects here. Welcome to my Data Engineering Portfolio! Each project is designed to demonstrate different aspects of data processing, transformation, and analysis using various tools and technologies.

## Projects

### 1. Analyzing Electric Vehicle Charging Habits

As electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, there is an increasing need for access to charging stations. In this project, I analyze station usage data to help apartment building managers better understand their tenants' EV charging habits.

- **Technologies:** SQL
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Find the number of unique individuals using each garageâ€™s shared charging stations.
  - Identify the top 10 most popular charging start times.
  - Discover users with average charging durations longer than 10 hours.

### 2. Bank Marketing Data Cleaning

This project involves cleaning and reformatting data from a bank's marketing campaign aimed at acquiring personal loans. The cleaned data is split into separate CSV files for further analysis.

- **Technologies:** Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Handle special characters and convert boolean values.
  - Standardize month names and create new columns.
  - Split cleaned data into client, campaign, and economics CSV files.

### 3. Analyzing Online Gaming Behavior with ETL Pipeline

This project processes a dataset containing information about online gaming behavior to extract meaningful insights. The data undergoes cleaning, transformation, and analysis using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

- **Technologies:** Jupyter Notebook, Python, Docker, Airflow, Spark, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Clean and transform the data.
  - Cluster players based on metrics like playtime and purchases.
  - Aggregate insights and generate CSV files with summarized metrics.

### 4. Server Log Processing

In this project, I process server log data to extract insights and monitor server performance. The project includes cleaning, transforming, and analyzing log entries to identify patterns and anomalies.

- **Technologies:** Jupyter Notebook, Python
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Parse and clean log data.
  - Identify and analyze patterns in server usage.
  - Detect anomalies and potential issues in server performance.
